    <h4>My Journey</h4>
    <p>My love affair with coding began long before I stepped foot into the classroom. As a curious teenager, I spent countless hours tinkering with websites, experimenting with programming languages, and devouring books on software development. Each line of code I wrote fueled my passion and deepened my understanding of this dynamic field.</p>
    <h4>Academic Pursuits</h4>
<p>Currently enrolled in Moringa School, I'm pursuing software engineering with a focus on Front-End Wed Developmet, React development and concentrations in Responsive Web Design and CSS Frameworks. Guided by knowledgeable professors and surrounded by like-minded peers, I'm constantly challenged to think critically, solve complex problems, and push the boundaries of innovation.</p>
